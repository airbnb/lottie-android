# 2.5.0
* Added the ability to dynamically change properties at runtime. See [docs](http://airbnb.io/lottie/android/dynamic.html) for more info. This feature removed the existing APIs for
changing the color dynamically with a color filter. Refer to the docs for migration info from 
existing ColorFilter APIs.
* Added a setRepeatMode and setRepeatCount (Thanks Fabio Nuno!).
* Completely overhauled json deserialization. Deserializing a composition takes half as long and
can deserialize much larger json files (tested 50mb) without ooming.
* Overhauled the underlying time animator. It now:
    * More accurately handles setFrame/getFrame/minFrame/maxFrame APIs. There were cases where they
    could be off by one before.
    * Renders at the fps specified by After Effects.
    * Added docs and clearer rules around animatedValue and animatedFraction in animator callbacks.
* API to remove all animator listeners.
* Adhere to the Animatable interface.
* Bumped the minSdk from 14 to 16 to use Choreographer in the animator mentioned above.
### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a bug that made it difficult to chain animations in onAnimationEnd callbacks.
* Fixed a regression with unknown masks modes.
* Fixed a crash trying to recycle a null bitmap.
* Fixed a bug when an opacity animation time interpolator was >1.

# 2.3.1
### Features and Improvements
* Expose `LottieComposition#getImages()` to aid in preloading images.
* Added support for text baseline.
### Bugs Fixed
* Prevented a crash when setting min frame > previous max frame.
* Fixed some bugs in subtract masks.
* Fixed some animation clamping when an animation was longer than its parent and time stretched.
* Stopped applying time stretch to a layer transform.


# 2.3.0
### Features and Improvements
* Animator fixes:
    * Previously, some usages of lottie animator apis/api listeners would cause unexpected
    behavior, especially calling apis from listener callbacks.
    * This is breaking change if you use `playAnimation(start, end)`. It has been removed in
    favor of explicit methods for `setMinFrame/Progress`, `setMaxFrame/Progress` and
    `setMinAndMaxFrame/Progress` followed by an explicit call to `playAnimation` or
    `resumeAnimation`.
    * `reverseAnimation` and `resumeReverseAnimation` apis have been removed in favor of
    `play` and `resume` with `speed` < 0.
    * If you have created hack around these limitations or complex animator chaining, please test
     your animations after updating.
* Set an animation from R.raw (res/raw) if you want static references to your animation files.
This can help prevent mismatches between api calls and file names. Thanks @cyrilmottier!
* Support for ellipse direction.
* Expose image directory name if set from bodymovin.
