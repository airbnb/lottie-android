* Ensure that the first frame is rendered when a new composition is set even if it is not yet playing.
* Properly render Telegram stickers that use [0,1] for color but [0,255] for alpha.
* Ensure that LottieDrawable has the correct bounds when the composition updates before Marshmallow.
* Fully clear off screen buffers pre-pie to prevent artifacts.
* Play, not resume animations if they are played while not shown.

# 3.3.1
### Bugs Fixed

* Add the ability to catch all Lottie composition errors with `setFailureListener` and 
`resetFailureListener` (#1321).
* Add the ability to set a fallback drawable res when Lottie fails to parse a composition or 
load it from the internet. Use `setFallbackResource` from code or`lottie_fallbackRes` from xml.
* Add the ability to render opacity on the layer level rather than the shape level. View the docs
 for `setApplyingOpacityToLayersEnabled` for more info.
* Add the ability to use dynamic properties on text that wasn't already animated.

* Disable animations when the system animation scale is 0.
* Fall back to hardware rendering when the animation is too large to create a drawing cache.

# 3.0.0
### Features and Improvements
* **Significant** mask and matte performance improvements by only calling saveLayer() on the intersection bounds of the content and mask/matte.
* Added support for dynamic properties on rectangles, gradient colors, and gradient fill opacity.
* Added support for inverted and intersect masks.

* Added support for multiple trim paths to be applied on a shape.
* Removed **all** memory allocations during playback including autoboxing.
* Replaced `enableHardwareAcceleration` with a new `setRenderMode` API because it has a third (`Automatic`) option. Refer to the docs for more info.
* Added an XML attr for animation speed (lottie_speed).
* Removed the recycleBitmaps() API because it is not neccesary anymore.

# 2.8.0
### Features and Improvements
* Migrated to androidx. This release and all future releases are only compatible with projects that have been migrated to androidx.

# 2.7.0
### Features and Improvements
* Removed deprecated LottieCompositionFactory APIs. If you were using JsonObjects, switch to Strings (#959).
* Made LottieTask.EXECUTOR public and static so tests can set it.
* Allow layer names to be stripped from JSON if desired.
* Allow returning null from LottieValueCallbacks to fall back to the default value.
### Bugs Fixed
* Allow text stroke width to be a double (#940).

# 2.6.0
### Features and Improvements
* Added support for loading an image from a url directly. See LottieCompositionFactory for more information.
* Added support for loading an animation from a zip file that contains the json as well as images.
    * URLs supports zip files as well as json files.
* Deprecated `LottieComposition.Factory` in favor of LottieCompositionFactory.
    * The new factory methods make it easier to catch exceptions by separating out success and
      failure handlers. Previously, catching exceptions was impossible and would crash your app.
    * All APIs now have a mandatory cacheKey that uses an LRU cache rather than a strong/weak ref cache.
    * If the same animation is fetched multiple times in parallel, the same task will be returned.
      This will be massively helpful for animations that are loaded in a list.
    * InputStreams are now always closed even if you use the old APIs. Please be aware if you were
      using this while upgrading.
* Added support for miter limit.
* [Sample App] Added the ability to load a file from assets.
### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a timing issue when there was time stretch on a masked layer.
* Fixed support for Android P.
* Make a best-effort attempt at rendering shapes in which the number of vertices changes rather than crashing.

# 2.5.7
* Reapply min/max frame once composition is loaded (#827).
* Fixed a bug that would ignore setting minFrame to 0 before the composition was set (#820).
* Prevented Lottie from drawing a recycled bitmap (#828).

# 2.5.6
* Added support for targeting Android P
* Fixed a potential dangling Choreographer callback ([#775](https://githubcom/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/775))

# 2.5.5
* Fixed end times for layers/animations. Before, if the layer/animation out frame was 20, it would fully render frame 20. This is incorrect. The last rendered frame should be 19.999... in this case. This should make Lottie reflect After Effects more accurately. However, if you are getting the frame in onAnimationEnd or onAnimationRepeat, it will be one less than it used to be.
* Added support for base64 encoded images directly in the json instead of the filename. They are 33% larger than their equivalent image file but enables you to have images with a single file.
* Fixed a lint error about KeyPath visibility.
* A few min/max progress bug fixes.
* Prevent autoPlay from starting before the animation was attached to the window. This caused animations in a RecyclerView to start playing before they were on screen.

# 2.5.4
* You can now call playAnimation() from onAnimationEnd
* Min/Max frames are clipped to the composition start/end
* setProgress takes into account start and end frame


# 2.5.2
### Features and Improvements

# 2.5.1
### Features and Improvements
* Removed framerate restriction introduced in 2.5.0 that caused Lottie to attempt to render at the After Effects framerate. This caused animations to appear unexpectedly janky in most cases.
### Bugs Fixed
* Many minor bug fixes around setting min/max frames
* Removed @RestrictTo on LottieValueCallback
* Improved thread safety of animation listeners
* Fixed looping when the animation speed is reversed


# 2.5.0
### Features and Improvements
* Added the ability to dynamically change properties at runtime. See [docs](http://airbnb.io/lottie/android/dynamic.html) for more info. This feature removed the existing APIs for
changing the color dynamically with a color filter. Refer to the docs for migration info from
existing ColorFilter APIs.
* Added a setRepeatMode and setRepeatCount (Thanks Fabio Nuno!).
* Completely overhauled json deserialization. Deserializing a composition takes half as long and
can deserialize much larger json files (tested 50mb) without ooming.
* Overhauled the underlying time animator. It now:
    * More accurately handles setFrame/getFrame/minFrame/maxFrame APIs. There were cases where they
    could be off by one before.
    * Renders at the fps specified by After Effects.
    * Added docs and clearer rules around animatedValue and animatedFraction in animator callbacks.
* API to remove all animator listeners.
* Adhere to the Animatable interface.
* Bumped the minSdk from 14 to 16 to use Choreographer in the animator mentioned above.

* Fixed a bug that made it difficult to chain animations in onAnimationEnd callbacks.
* Fixed a regression with unknown masks modes.
* Fixed a crash trying to recycle a null bitmap.

* Fixed some animation clamping when an animation was longer than its parent and time stretched.
* Stopped applying time stretch to a layer transform.


# 2.3.0
### Features and Improvements
* Animator fixes:
    * Previously, some usages of lottie animator apis/api listeners would cause unexpected
    behavior, especially calling apis from listener callbacks.
    * This is breaking change if you use `playAnimation(start, end)`. It has been removed in
    favor of explicit methods for `setMinFrame/Progress`, `setMaxFrame/Progress` and
    `setMinAndMaxFrame/Progress` followed by an explicit call to `playAnimation` or
    `resumeAnimation`.
    * `reverseAnimation` and `resumeReverseAnimation` apis have been removed in favor of
    `play` and `resume` with `speed` < 0.
    * If you have created hack around these limitations or complex animator chaining, please test
     your animations after updating.
* Set an animation from R.raw (res/raw) if you want static references to your animation files.
This can help prevent mismatches between api calls and file names. Thanks @cyrilmottier!
* Support for ellipse direction.
* Expose image directory name if set from bodymovin.
