# 5.0.1
### New Features
* [Removed API] Removed the `setScale(float)` APIs from `LottieAnimationView` and `LottieDrawable`. The expected behavior was highly ambiguous when paired with other scale types and canvas transformations. For the vast majority of cases, ImageView.ScaleType should be sufficient. For remaining cases, you may apply transformations to Canvas and use `LottieDrawable#draw` directly. 
* Added support for the "Rounded Corners" effect on Shape and Rect layers ([#1953](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1953))
* Prior to 5.0, LottieAnimationView would _always_ call [setLayerType](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setLayerType(int,%20android.graphics.Paint)) with either [HARDWARE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE) or [SOFTWARE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE). In the hardware case, this would case Android to allocate a dedicated hardware buffer for the animation that had to be uploaded to the GPU separately. In the software case, LottieAnimationView would rely on View's internal [drawing cache](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#isDrawingCacheEnabled()).

    This has a few disadvantages:

  * The hardware/software distinction happened at the LottieAnimationView level. That means that consumers of LottieDrawable (such as lottie-compose) had no way to
          choose a render mode.
  * Dedicated memory for Lottie was _always_ allocated. In the software case, it would be a bitmap that is the size of the LottieAnimationView and in the hardware case, it was a dedicated hardware layer.
  
  Benefits as a result of this change:

  * Reduced memory consumption. In the hardware case, no new memory is allocated. In the software case, Lottie will create a bitmap that is the intersection of your View/Composition bounds mapped with the drawing transformation which often yields a surface are that is smaller than the entire LottieAnimationView.
  * lottie-compose now supports setting a RenderMode.
  * Custom uses of LottieDrawable now support setting a RenderMode via [setRenderMode](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L329).
* Lottie can now render outside of its composition bounds. To allow this with views such as LottieAnimationView, set `clipToCompositionBounds` to false on `LottieDrawable` or `LottieAnimationView` and `clipChildren` to false on the parent view. For Compose, use the `clipToCompositionBounds` parameter.
* Prior to 5.0, LottieAnimationView handled all animation controls when the view's visibility or attach state changed. This worked fine for consumers of LottieAnimationView. However, custom uses of LottieDrawable were prone to leaking infinite animators if they did not properly handle cancelling animations correctly. This opens up the possibility for unexpected behavior and increased battery drain. Lottie now behaves more like animated drawables in the platform and moves this logic into the Drawable via its [setVisible](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable#setVisible(boolean,%20boolean)) API. This should lead to no explicit behavior changes if you are using LottieAnimationView. However, if you are using LottieDrawable directly and were explicitly pausing/cancelling animations on lifecycle changes, you may want to cross check your expected behavior with that of LottieDrawable after this update. This change also resolved a long standing bug when Lottie is used in RecyclerViews due to the complex way in which RecyclerView handles View lifecycles ([#1495](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1495)).
  [#1981](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1981)
* Add an API [setClipToCompositionBounds](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L218) on LottieAnimationView, LottieDrawable, and the LottieAnimation composable to prevent Lottie from clipping animations to the composition bounds.
* Add an API to always render dynamically set bitmaps at the original animation bounds. Previously, dynamically set bitmaps would be rendered at their own size anchored to the top left
  of the original bitmap. This meant that if you wanted to supply a lower resolution bitmap to save memory, it would render smaller. The default behavior remains the same but you can
  enable [setMaintainOriginalImageBounds](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L264) to be able to supply lower resolution bitmaps ([#1706](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1706)).
* Add support for `LottieProperty.TEXT` to use dynamic properties for text. This enables dynamic text support for lottie-compose ([#1995](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1495)).
* Add getters for Marker fields ([#1998](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1998))
* Add support for reversed polystar paths ([#2003](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2003))

* Fix a bug that would only render part of a path if the trim path extended from 0-100 and had an offset ([#1999](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1999))
* Add support for languages that use DIRECTIONALITY_NONSPACING_MARK like Hindi ([#2001](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2001))
* Prevent LottieAnimationView from overwriting user actions when restoring instance state ([#2002](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2002))

exposing Lottie's copy of Moshi's json parser.
* Add the ability to catch all Lottie composition errors with `setFailureListener` and
`resetFailureListener` (#1321).
* Add the ability to set a fallback drawable res when Lottie fails to parse a composition or
load it from the internet. Use `setFallbackResource` from code or`lottie_fallbackRes` from xml.
* Add the ability to render opacity on the layer level rather than the shape level. View the docs
 for `setApplyingOpacityToLayersEnabled` for more info.
* Add the ability to use dynamic properties on text that wasn't already animated.

* Added support for multiple trim paths to be applied on a shape.
* Removed **all** memory allocations during playback including autoboxing.
* Replaced `enableHardwareAcceleration` with a new `setRenderMode` API because it has a third (`Automatic`) option. Refer to the docs for more info.

# 2.8.0
### Features and Improvements
* Migrated to androidx. This release and all future releases are only compatible with projects that have been migrated to androidx.

# 2.7.0
### Features and Improvements
* Removed deprecated LottieCompositionFactory APIs. If you were using JsonObjects, switch to Strings (#959).
* Made LottieTask.EXECUTOR public and static so tests can set it.
* Allow layer names to be stripped from JSON if desired.
* Allow returning null from LottieValueCallbacks to fall back to the default value.
### Bugs Fixed
* Allow text stroke width to be a double (#940).

# 2.6.0
### Features and Improvements
* Added support for loading an image from a url directly. See LottieCompositionFactory for more information.
* Added support for loading an animation from a zip file that contains the json as well as images.
    * URLs supports zip files as well as json files.
* Deprecated `LottieComposition.Factory` in favor of LottieCompositionFactory.
    * The new factory methods make it easier to catch exceptions by separating out success and
      failure handlers. Previously, catching exceptions was impossible and would crash your app.
    * All APIs now have a mandatory cacheKey that uses an LRU cache rather than a strong/weak ref cache.
    * If the same animation is fetched multiple times in parallel, the same task will be returned.
      This will be massively helpful for animations that are loaded in a list.
    * InputStreams are now always closed even if you use the old APIs. Please be aware if you were
      using this while upgrading.
* Added support for miter limit.
* [Sample App] Added the ability to load a file from assets.
### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a timing issue when there was time stretch on a masked layer.
* Fixed support for Android P.
* Make a best-effort attempt at rendering shapes in which the number of vertices changes rather than crashing.
* Fixed a bug in which the inner radius animation of a polystar wouldn't update.

# 2.5.7
* Reapply min/max frame once composition is loaded (#827).
* Fixed a bug that would ignore setting minFrame to 0 before the composition was set (#820).
* Prevented Lottie from drawing a recycled bitmap (#828).

# 2.5.6
* Added support for targeting Android P
* Fixed a potential dangling Choreographer callback ([#775](https://githubcom/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/775))

# 2.5.5
* Fixed end times for layers/animations. Before, if the layer/animation out frame was 20, it would fully render frame 20. This is incorrect. The last rendered frame should be 19.999... in this case. This should make Lottie reflect After Effects more accurately. However, if you are getting the frame in onAnimationEnd or onAnimationRepeat, it will be one less than it used to be.
* Added support for base64 encoded images directly in the json instead of the filename. They are 33% larger than their equivalent image file but enables you to have images with a single file.
* Fixed a lint error about KeyPath visibility.
* A few min/max progress bug fixes.
* Prevent autoPlay from starting before the animation was attached to the window. This caused animations in a RecyclerView to start playing before they were on screen.

# 2.5.4
* You can now call playAnimation() from onAnimationEnd
* Min/Max frames are clipped to the composition start/end
* setProgress takes into account start and end frame


# 2.5.2
### Features and Improvements

    * Rebuilt from the ground up.
    * Lottiefiles integration
    * Render times per layer
    * Can open zip files with images from lottiefiles, even with qr scanning.
    * Change speed
# Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a regression with ellipse direction

# 2.5.1
### Features and Improvements
* Removed framerate restriction introduced in 2.5.0 that caused Lottie to attempt to render at the After Effects framerate. This caused animations to appear unexpectedly janky in most cases.
### Bugs Fixed
* Many minor bug fixes around setting min/max frames
* Removed @RestrictTo on LottieValueCallback
* Improved thread safety of animation listeners
* Fixed looping when the animation speed is reversed


# 2.5.0
### Features and Improvements
* Added the ability to dynamically change properties at runtime. See [docs](http://airbnb.io/lottie/android/dynamic.html) for more info. This feature removed the existing APIs for
changing the color dynamically with a color filter. Refer to the docs for migration info from
existing ColorFilter APIs.
* Added a setRepeatMode and setRepeatCount (Thanks Fabio Nuno!).
* Completely overhauled json deserialization. Deserializing a composition takes half as long and
can deserialize much larger json files (tested 50mb) without ooming.
* Overhauled the underlying time animator. It now:
    * More accurately handles setFrame/getFrame/minFrame/maxFrame APIs. There were cases where they
    could be off by one before.
    * Renders at the fps specified by After Effects.
    * Added docs and clearer rules around animatedValue and animatedFraction in animator callbacks.
* API to remove all animator listeners.
* Adhere to the Animatable interface.
* Bumped the minSdk from 14 to 16 to use Choreographer in the animator mentioned above.
### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a bug that made it difficult to chain animations in onAnimationEnd callbacks.
* Fixed a regression with unknown masks modes.
* Fixed a crash trying to recycle a null bitmap.

* Added support for text baseline.
### Bugs Fixed
* Prevented a crash when setting min frame > previous max frame.
* Fixed some bugs in subtract masks.
* Fixed some animation clamping when an animation was longer than its parent and time stretched.
* Stopped applying time stretch to a layer transform.


# 2.3.0
### Features and Improvements
* Animator fixes:
    * Previously, some usages of lottie animator apis/api listeners would cause unexpected
    behavior, especially calling apis from listener callbacks.
    * This is breaking change if you use `playAnimation(start, end)`. It has been removed in
    favor of explicit methods for `setMinFrame/Progress`, `setMaxFrame/Progress` and
    `setMinAndMaxFrame/Progress` followed by an explicit call to `playAnimation` or
    `resumeAnimation`.
    * `reverseAnimation` and `resumeReverseAnimation` apis have been removed in favor of
    `play` and `resume` with `speed` < 0.
    * If you have created hack around these limitations or complex animator chaining, please test
     your animations after updating.
* Set an animation from R.raw (res/raw) if you want static references to your animation files.
This can help prevent mismatches between api calls and file names. Thanks @cyrilmottier!
* Support for ellipse direction.
* Expose image directory name if set from bodymovin.
### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed a bug with animations that use both mattes and time stretch.

* Fixed a crash when animations are disabled.
* Fixed a crash for letters with no shapes.


# 2.2.0
### Features and Improvements
* Added `play(startFrame, endFrame)` and `play(startProgress, endProgress)`.
* Added the ability to set a minimum and maximum frame/progress for a given animation.
* Made WeakRef the default cache strategy.
### Bugs Fixed
* Cancel loading animations when non-Lottie animations are set.

# 2.1.2
